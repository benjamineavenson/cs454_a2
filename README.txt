CS454 Assignment 2 - Ranking Algorithms
WSU Fall 2020

To use the ranking algorithms, create a python file and import ranking.

You can then call ranking.tf_idf(query, num) or ranking.bm25(query, num) to call either ranking
algorithm with the given query and recieve a number of results specified by num.

wine.csv must be in the same directory as your python file.
